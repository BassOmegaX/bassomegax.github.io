# Health
Dante starts with 1000 HP. Each whole blue orb adds 100 HP. The maximum HP attainable is 3000.

## Low HP
Dante cannot die in one hit if he has 300 HP or more. When he has 300 or more HP, and he takes an attack that does more damage than his remaining HP, he will not die, and his health will be set to 0. When his health is under 300 HP though, a hit that takes him under 0 HP will kill him. A visual indication of this is the border of his HP bar turns red. Note that the bar turns red starting at exactly 300 HP, so there is an edge case.

# Devil Trigger Gauge
Each rune of DT is worth 120 points. When DT is activate, the value is converted to 200 points per rune and drains at a rate of 1 point per frame. Thus, each rune of DT lasts $3 \frac{1}{3}$ seconds.
