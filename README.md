# Health
Dante starts with 1000 HP. Each whole blue orb adds 100 HP. The maximum HP attainable is 3000.

## Low HP
Dante cannot die in one hit if he has more than 300 HP. When he has more than 300 HP, and he takes an attack that does more damage than his remaining HP, he will not die, and his health will be set to 0. When his health is 300 HP or less though, a hit that takes him under 0 HP will kill him. A visual indication of this is when the HP bar turns red. Note that this is not the same as when the HP bar border turns red, which starts at under 300 HP.

# Devil Trigger Gauge
Each rune of DT is worth 120 points. When DT is activated, the value is converted to 200 points per rune and drains at a rate of 1 point per frame.

# Difficulty Changes in regards to Damage

## Regular Enemies

*Enemies activating Devil Trigger triples their damage to Dante. For defensive values after Devil Triggering, Marionettes and Fetishes take 1/2 damage. Sin Scissors, Sin Scythes, Sargassos, Plasmas, and Green Beelzebubs take 1/3 damage. Blue Beelzebubs takes 1/6 damage. See Bestiary.

## Bosses 

| Difficulty Mode      | Damage you do | Damage taken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal      | 1x |    1x   |
| Hard   |  1/3x, 1x*  |   2x  |
|Dante Must Die! | 1/3x | 5x |

* You do regular damage to bosses when you Devil Trigger and use a melee attack. DT'd firearm attacks and all nonDT attacks do 1/3 damage.


# Stylish Meter
Forget everything about the Stylish meter in DMC3 and onwards, the Stylish meter in DMC1 is basically a combo meter.

Each attack to an enemy will earn points in the visible Stylish meter. For High Time, Magma Drive, or Meteor, the next attack following these attacks will also add a bonus value. When an attack connects, you have 1 second(60 frames) to maintain the Style meter by hitting an enemy with another attack. Charging Roundtrip, charging Ifrit attacks, or taunting will pause the timer. 

Each attack has a designated number of red orbs it adds to the total. This is multiplied by the current Style meter multiplier to add to the total number of red orbs. This accumulated amount will never go away, even if you lose the Style meter. 

The only bosses that gain additional red orbs from the Stylish meter upon defeat are Nightmare and Shadow Nelo Angelo.

|Stylish Rank| Points Needed | Red Orb Multiplier|
|---|---|---|
|Dull| 11 or lower | 1x | 
|Cool!| 12-47 | 2x |
|Bravo!| 48-63 | 3x |
|Absolute!| 64-127 | 5x |
|Stylish!|128 or higher | 10x |
